# Maximum-Credit-Limit-Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the maximum credit limit (US Dollar). The credit limits are categorized into four distinct classes. 


Class 1 = credit limit <= 100,000

Class 2 = credit limit > 100,000 & <= 200000

Class 3 = credit limit > 100,000 & <= 300000

Class 4 = credit limit > 300,000
